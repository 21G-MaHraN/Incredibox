# Incredibox, full version
This repository contains the **original code** of the mobile version of Incredibox, extracted and modified to work on a web page. _(it's a kind of port)_
## Why the v9 is here?
> - I was able to backport v9, but due to changes in the Incredibox app's code, I had to redo every little thing to fit the old format and make it work. Now it's ready and working! _(i think lol)_
### ***All of this is property of SO FAR SO GOOD***, i'm just a guy who "borrowed" his code and modified it lol.
The web app should be working right now, check ***environments*** to see if it's working. If you can't see anything, then you should try **[this link](https://oxtaa.github.io/incredibox)** instead. If it isn't working, you should tell me what's happening at my Discord _(oxtaa\_)_
