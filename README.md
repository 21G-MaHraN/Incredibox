# Incredibox, full version
This repository contains the **original code** of the mobile version of Incredibox, specifically v0.5.7. I extracted and modified it to make it work on a web page. _(it's a kind of port)_
## About the v9
> v9 came out, you can play it just fine since I backported it to v0.5.7, all bonus work as they should, even if they have different loop count.
### ***All of this is property of SO FAR SO GOOD***, i'm just a guy who "borrowed" his code and modified it lol.
The web app should be working right now, check ***environments*** to see if it's working. If you can't see anything, then you should try **[this link](https://oxtaa.github.io/incredibox)** instead. If it isn't working, you should tell me what's happening at my Discord _(oxtaa\_)_
