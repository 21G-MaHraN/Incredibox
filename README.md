# Incredibox, full web app.
This repository contains the **original code** of Incredibox, extracted from the PC version and modified to work on a web page. _(yup, it's a kind of port)_
### Obviously, ***all of this is property of SO FAR SO GOOD***, i'm just a guy who took his code and modified it lol.
The web app should be working right now, check ***environments*** to see if it's working. If you can't see anything, then you can try **[this link](https://oxtaa.github.io/incredibox)** instead. If it isn't working, you should tell me what's happening at my Discord _(oxtaa\_)_
