# Incredibox, full web app.
This repository contains the **original code** of Incredibox Mobile extracted and modified to work on a web page. _(yes, it's a kind of port)_
## Why the v9 is here?
> - I was able to add v9, but due to changes in the Incredibox application's code, I had to redo every little thing to fit the old format and make it work in your browser. Now i'ts ready and working perfectly! _(i think lol)_
### Obviously, ***all of this is property of SO FAR SO GOOD***, i'm just a guy who took his code and modified it lol.
The web app should be working right now, check ***environments*** to view that. If you can't see it, then you can try **[this link](https://oxtaa.github.io/incredibox)** instead. If it isn't working, you should tell me that problem at my Discord _(oxta.#8355)_
